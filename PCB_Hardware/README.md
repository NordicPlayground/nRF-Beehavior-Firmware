# README


## Abstract

This is a README file for the PCB_hardware project.
This readme should give you a good introduction to the PCB, so that you can improve the design and make changes of your own. In short, this PCB converts power from a solar panal in to stable 5V. **The PCB is therefor a _DC-DC converter_**, and will be refered to this throughout this readme. The output voltage can then be used to charge a powerbank (10 000 mA) which will be the main battery for the whole nRF-Beehavior-Firmware system. If 1 powerbank is not enough to power the system, you can easly connect another powerbank but this may require you to solde up another DC-DC converter.
