# README


## Abstract

This is a README file for the PCB_hardware project.
This readme should give you a good introduction to the PCB, so that you can improve the design and make changes of your own. In short, this PCB converts power from a solar panal in to stable 5V. **The PCB is therefor a _DC-DC converter_**, and will be refered to this throughout this readme. 

## Background

One of the goals of the nRF-Beehavior project is that the system can run independently on batteries and charge itself. To de this we have decides that we are going to use solar panels. The input of the DC-DC converter is therefor directly connected to the spolar panel which fluctuate around 6V depending on the weather. The output voltage of this DC-DC converter can then be used to charge a powerbank (10 000 mA) which will be the main battery for the whole nRF-Beehavior system. The whole system has not yet been tested so we can't garantee that 1 powerbank is enough. If 1 powerbank is not enough, you can easly connect another powerbank but this may require you to solde up another DC-DC converter amd get more solar panels.
